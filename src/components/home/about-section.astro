  I’m <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold">Chaitanya Tatikonda</span>, an Information Technology graduate from Florida State University, where I completed my degree with a 4.0 GPA.
  <br /><br />
  I work as a Software Engineer with a focus on <span class="text-blue-500 font-semibold">Web Development</span> and <span class="text-blue-500 font-semibold">DevOps</span>. I enjoy building thoughtful, user-centered solutions that not only look and feel right, but also support real business needs through reliable performance and scalable design.
  <br /><br />
  My experience spans startups, mid-sized companies, and enterprise teams, helping me stay adaptable and collaborative across different environments. I’m comfortable working closely with both technical and non-technical teams to turn ideas into working products.
  <br /><br />
  Outside of engineering, I’m into photography, a creative outlet that keeps my attention to detail sharp and helps me see design from a more visual, user-oriented perspective.
