    I am <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold">Chaitanya Tatikonda</span>, a
    graduate in Information Technology from Florida State University, with a 4.0
    GPA.
    <br /><br />
    I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for both <span
      class="text-blue-500 font-semibold">Web Development</span
    > and <span class="text-blue-500 font-semibold">DevOps</span>. I enjoy
    building end-to-end solutions that are functional, scalable, and
    user-friendly. From crafting front-end interfaces to automating
    infrastructure, I like being involved throughout the development lifecycle.
    <br /><br />
    I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of teams - startups, mid-sized
    companies, and larger organizations, which has helped me develop adaptability,
    resilience, and effective communication and collaboration skills.
    <br /><br />
    When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring photography, my creative
    outlet that also influences how I approach design.
