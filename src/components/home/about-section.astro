    I am <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold">Chaitanya Tatikonda</span>, an
    Information Technology graduate from Florida State University with a 4.0
    GPA.
    <br /><br />
    As a Software Engineer, I specialize in <span
      class="text-blue-500 font-semibold">Web Development</span
    > and <span class="text-blue-500 font-semibold">DevOps</span> practices. My expertise
    enables me to develop comprehensive solutions that address business requirements—from
    creating responsive interfaces to implementing efficient cloud infrastructure.
    <br /><br />
    My professional experience spans diverse organizational environments, including
    startups, mid-sized companies, and enterprise teams. This breadth of experience
    has enhanced my adaptability and communication skills, allowing me to collaborate
    effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    <br /><br />
    Beyond my technical endeavors, I pursue photography as a creative interest. This
    practice refines my attention to detail and visual perspective—qualities that
    complement my professional work in creating thoughtful, user-centered digital
    experiences.
